 MNM_counteract_german_alignment_desc:0 "The Germans wield deep influence on our State through economic ties, diplomacy and various German statesmen spread throughout Europe.

 MNM_counteract_foreign_influences_desc:0 "Foreign Influences are affecting our politics and public opinions. While this may be possible to live with, and it may even be desirable in some cases, we do have the option of doing something about it.

 MNM_counteract_us_pressure:0 "Counteract US Political Pressure"
 MNM_counteract_us_pressure_desc:0 "The Americans have long regarded the American Continents as their backyard, influencing countries towards policies and politics beneficial to themselves. With reasons ranging from keeping further European influence out, making profitable trade deals, blocking attempts at nationalization, or even simply making sure no other power in the Western Hemisphere could challenge US hegemony in said hemisphere, [USA.GetNameDef] holds an indirect, yet firm, grip on the Americas.\n\nNevertheless, with a stable leadership, we could probably manage to shake off said influence, should we so desire."
